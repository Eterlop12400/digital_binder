## Confirmshaming – the art of insulting your target group
This resource is an article that focuses on what confirmshaming is and how tone affects your audience. The article dives into some examples such as Hipcamp which insults the user by not signing up to their newsletter they would have to click on a link that says 'No thanks, I’m not a fan of the outdoors' which is a blatant insult to the user. The article also dives into more examples which each shows ways of how confirmshaming negatively pushes you, users, away and how your tone affects your audience.

![confirmshaming example](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*TEiKQIX4Kz5YwgLd.jpg)

* An example of conirmshaming is the intrusive, unsolicited subscription forms promising you the holy grail of insights and knowledge.


* Not only is confirmshaming a poor lack of judgment and offensive behavior on display but it drives users away.

## Aesthetic-Usability Effect
This resource is an article that focuses on the origins of the aesthetic-usability effect. The article also points out some key takeaways as presented below in the bullet points. This information is helpful as it helps support the focus on making aesthetic designs and content for my projects.  

* An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.


* People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.


* Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing.

* The aesthetic-usability effect was first studied in the field of human-computer interaction in 1995.

## How to Fix the 8 Most Common Visual Content Design Mistakes
This resource is an article that focuses on common design mistakes and how to fix them. The article starts off by stating that visual content is a crucial ingredient in your content marketing, as studies have shown it’s more likely to be shared, clicked on, and engaged with. The article then continues to go through mistakes such as sloppy hierarchy, misaligned mayhem, chaotic color schemes, illustration overkill, typography trainwreck, data disasters, icon overload, and wrong resolution. With each point, the article focuses on ways to overcome those mistakes and points on what you should and can do. This will help me as I continue to work on my wireframes this week.


* Visual content is a crucial ingredient in your content marketing, as studies have shown it’s more likely to be shared, clicked on, and engaged with.


* Anchor your visual to a main focal point. This point should help your reader quickly grasp what the most important part of your message is.


* Prioritize simplicity. Don’t include elements that distract from each other or compete directly with your focal point.

* Use negative space to your advantage. Sometimes a little breather and empty space can help guide the eye to where it needs to be.

* Watch your edges. The amount of space from the edge of your graphic should be consistent all around, especially where the header starts and the footer ends.

* Keep consistent. Use consistent spacing between sections, and keep an eye out for headers and copy.

* Use one dominant color and two accent colors. If you have to do more, be conservative.

* Keep it simple. Pick a single font family to work with.

## 5 Essential UX Rules for Dialog Design
This resource is an article that focuses on essential UX rules for dialog design. The article starts by explaining what a dialog is which states a dialog is an overlay that requires the user to interact with it and is designed to elicit a response from the user. Dialogs inform users about critical information, require users to make decisions, or involve multiple tasks. The article then dives into dialog design best practices and use cases for them. The best practices were reduced interruption, the match between dialog and the real world, striving for minimalism, selecting proper dialog type, and visual consistency. I included some key takeaways in the bullet points below. These will help me when I make more design decisions while making projects.
 


* A dialog is an overlay that requires the user to interact with it and is designed to elicit a response from the user. Dialogs inform users about critical information, require users to make decisions, or involve multiple tasks. 


* Suddenly opening a dialog without the user having done anything is a very bad idea.


* It makes the most sense to use a dialog in situations where you need the user to interact before continuing, or when the cost of an error could be very high.

*  Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive. Their sudden appearance forces users to stop their current tasks and focus on the dialog content.

* You shouldn’t try to cram too much into a dialog. Keep it clean and simple (follow the KISS principle). But minimalist doesn’t mean limited. All information should be valuable and relevant.

## 15 Timeless Rules for Creating Intuitive Web Apps
This resource is an article that focuses on some key rules to keep in mind while working on the site design. The article states that every founder should be aware of these rules and that a web app that’s difficult to figure out, unintuitive, or inefficient is not going to win many hearts. Some of the rules the article mentioned were don't reinvent patterns, group-related elements, less is better, plan before developing, provide feedback, and much more. These rules and explanations are very important and very insightful and will be helpful when working on a site's design.

* Every founder should be aware of these rules. User experience has very little to do with Photoshop and a lot to do with how well your product gets adopted on the market. Nowadays, users don’t have to settle for a less-than-perfect user experience. If you fail to effectively satisfy their needs, they’ll simply move to your competition. 


* A web app that’s difficult to figure out, unintuitive, or inefficient is not going to win many hearts.


* Use patterns you see in popular apps to help users learn your interface. These patterns can be color (using red for errors), icons (envelope is a recognized symbol for messages), and placing (“forward” button is always on the right-hand side).

* Take some time to break down your app into a wireframe before starting to code. Making changes later is far from easy. UX should be a priority before everything else starts.

## The awkward conversation about wireframes in the design process
This resource is an article that focuses on different aspects of the importance of wireframes. The article starts off with a question Do you need wireframes? Who uses them anyway? Is producing wireframes just a waste of time and resources? Then the article starts going into each of these questions and starts establishing the importance of if wireframes should be brought to the table, different scenarios they would be important, and the different groups of people and teams who would use wireframes. At the end of the day, you have to weigh the pros and cons of if the importance outweighs the time and resources.

![potential project flow](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*RLAROGIksS-1a92je9Leag.jpeg)

* Debating the topic in our design team revealed that there are varying perspectives and opinions when it comes to wireframes and their purpose. In the end, wireframes are only one document in the entire design production process.


* Get your team together, talk and create a common and unified understanding. Define attributes for your deliverables to help you judge their value and need in a specific project.

## Space in Design Systems
This resource is an article that focuses on different aspects of the importance of space in designs. The article starts off by stating that space in design rivals color, after removing effects (“zeroed” values like :0; and reserved terms like transparent or auto) where CSS already offers us a system for decisions, space rules appeared more than anything except color. The article talks about different key points on space in design, how to look at the different ways to use space on an element, and how that impacts the overall design. This information will be helpful as I work on my high-fidelity wireframes this week and when I lay out my elements.

![cheatsheet of spatial concepts](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-c4UabSTLW9fnz9OGwrP5Q.png)

* Space is everywhere. CSS uses properties like padding, margin, and absolute positioning’s left, right, top, and bottom to separate objects. 


* These concepts — inset, inset squish, inset stretch, stack, inline, and grid — cover the vast majority of our library’s CSS rules for space: padding, margin, left, right, top, and bottom. These concepts also enhance how each atomic is self-contained, improving composability.


* Using space concepts requires us to adapt to something new. On my team, it took a day for light skepticism to give way to embrace the new model.

## GitHub Project Boards
This resource is a video that focuses on the GitHub workflow and provides more details about GitHub's version of a Kanban board/Project board. The video states that project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. The video goes through a step-by-step guide on how to create a project board and what you can do with it. This will be helpful as I work with the GitHub project board now and in the future.

## The (Somewhat) definitive guide to building better APIs
This resource is an article that focuses on tips that help us avoid common errors when designing an API. The article states what APIs mean which states APIs are the default means of communication between the systems. The article then starts talking about the principle of designing RESTful APIs such as keeping it simple (KISS), using nouns, not verbs, using the right HTTP methods, using plurals, using parameters, and much more. Below are some highlighted key concepts from the article that I found most useful.

![KISS Concept](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*UXHznlC6cWOCSV6c.jpg)

* APIs are the default means of communication between the systems.


* In order to keep all teams in your company abiding by certain principles, the use of OpenAPI Specification can be useful. Open API allows you to design your APIs first and share that with the consumers in an easier manner.


* It is quite evident that if you want to communicate better, APIs are the way to go. But if they are designed badly then it might increase confusion. So put best efforts to design well and the rest is just the implementation.

## Why you should always do documentation before development
This resource is an article that focuses on the importance and benefits of focusing on documenting it out before you start developing it. Some of the benefits of focusing first on documenting before developing are the results is a more focused development cycle because instead of rumbling toward a vague idea of an application, treating documentation as the first tier of bug reports and feature requests is a great way to shield a project against UI creep, and so much more. This article has helped reinforce the idea and importance of documenting a project before developing it. 

* Doc-driven development focuses your code toward a specific blueprint of how an application is meant to work.


* The developer may not realize it, but as the idea formulates, there's a kind of documentation happening already. Ideas don't just appear fully formed with every detail mapped out in a tidy blueprint ready to be hooked up to lonely lines of code. Ideas happen gradually.


* If you focus on documentation as a roadmap the result is a more focused development cycle because instead of rumbling toward a vague idea of an application, developers code toward a specific blueprint of exactly how an application is meant to work.  

* The agile method of development needs feedback from users and stakeholders to guide the direction of what's developed next. Documentation doesn't change that. In fact, in the best doc-driven dev environment, the documentation itself is treated exactly the same as source code. It gets committed to the same repository as the rest of the sources, and it gets updated before anything else.

* Treating documentation as the first tier of bug reports and feature requests is a great way to shield a project against UI creep. 


* Documentation tends to produce consistency in how an application works because the internal logic is mapped out well in advance.

## Thinking About React, Atomically
This resource is an article that focuses on the Atomic design pattern and how it can be combined with React. The article starts off by explaining what the Atomic design pattern is which states the Atomic design pattern is a fantastic design system that, when implemented correctly, can cause the elements of your application’s user interface to stitch together beautifully and simply. The article then goes into detail on how this design pattern can fit in the same concepts as React such as components on a page. The article concludes by stating React, at its core, follows Atomic Design inherently by encouraging developers to keep components as simple and as broken down as possible. As I plan out my components this week I will keep this design pattern in mind.

![Atomic Breakdown](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*m2fb_YCpY3WUJxKNUjLPdA.png)

* The Atomic design pattern is a fantastic design system that, when implemented correctly, can cause the elements of your application’s user interface to stitch together beautifully and simply. 


* Using these smaller atoms, molecules, and organisms, we can build templates for future pages (instances of templates) and make our design process so much quicker.


* Components, if possible, should be dumb. They should have no knowledge of an application’s business logic and just render what they are meant to render.

## 10 Common UI Design Mistakes That Are Killing Your Conversion Rate
This resource is an article that focuses on common UI design mistakes and how that is affecting users. The article goes into detail on each of the common UI design mistakes and reflects on how that impacts a user and the result of what that means which can lead users from just leaving your site. Some of the common UI mistakes listed in this article are Unresponsive Design, Cluttered Layout, Unintuitive Navigation, Generic Imagery, and more. Keeping these mistakes in mind, I know I can improve my design this week for my wireframes and prototype.

* As of April 2018, 3.8 million people across the globe were using their mobile devices to go online. When customers can’t enjoy the best features of your website on their small screens, they leave.


* Cluttered websites are frustrating to users. When there are too many elements on one page, they are all competing for a user’s attention and add effort to the buyer’s journey.


* A lack of hierarchy can be very confusing to a user, and it doesn’t flatter your products and services.

* Visuals play a crucial role in branding and marketing: to attract the visitors’ attention and make them relate to the happy customer smiling in the photo. By doing so, it helps to set a tone and create a mood.

## Prototyping
This resource is an article that is provided by Adobe that focuses on the importance of prototyping. The article goes over many different questions such as what is the purpose of prototyping, what are the different types of prototyping, and who should prototype. Having these questions has helped me understand the importance of prototyping and why it is needed. Below are some key concepts I took away from this article.

* Prototyping is an integral part of the design process. It allows you to turn a vision into something tangible in order to test your hypothesis with real users.


* Prototyping saves you time and money, and most importantly, helps you build a better product for your users.


* There are various types of prototyping in design, including sketching, paper prototypes, low-fidelity wireframes, and interactive and HTML prototypes. The right prototyping to use depends on factors like what problems you’re trying to solve and the resources available to you.

* From business professionals and developers to designers and those in UX/UI and beyond, all have something to gain from prototyping.

### What resource(s) did you find most helpful for this research assignment and why?

The resources that I found most helpful for this research assignment this week would be **Why you should always do documentation before development** and **Thinking About React, Atomically**. Starting off I found **Why you should always do documentation before development** helpful because I knew that I am supposed to document my work but I didn't truly understand the importance of what I was doing and what that means in the long run with my projects. This article gave me plenty of helpful insight into the process and the benefits. Next, I found **Thinking About React, Atomically** helpful as I have always loved this design pattern when learning about it months ago, the article explained more of how React and the Atomic design pattern work hand in hand and how everything relates in this design pattern and I could digest that information and hopefully apply it in my projects. Although, I would like to states that I found each resource helpful but these were the highlight resources for this week.
