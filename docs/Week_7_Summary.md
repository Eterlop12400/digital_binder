This week for my progress check, I wanted to report what I accomplished, what challenges I faced, what steps I have taken to get over those challenges, and lastly, my next steps leading into the following week. To start things off, some accomplishments I achieved this week are researching many different topics relating to Axios, React State, Bcrypt, and more. I dove into working on my frontend after completing my research. Some challenges that I faced this week were setting up my login system and adding validation where needed. I overcame this challenge by doing some independent research and taking things one step at a time. Lastly, I wanted to talk about what I plan to do next. Next week I plan to focus on refactoring my code on the frontend and backend and I want to try and attempt deploying my application on Heroku. That concludes my stand-up this week.
