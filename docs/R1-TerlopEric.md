## Framework for Finding your idea, and Refining it

This article broke down a product framework step-by-step, going through each step in detail which ranged from how to determine a target audience, the main problem you wish to solve, coming up with a solution based on your main problem, different use cases, and more. Beyond learning more about how to develop a product from the ground up and the different considerations when taking those steps, I learned that I need to take my users into consideration which are not just the good users but the bad users as well. Thinking of ways to help good users and to prevent bad intentions from bad users.

![Product Framework](https://miro.medium.com/max/1110/1*DXd26ltiGXY0zjxgdJrxHw.png)

* Using a framework for finding your idea and refining it is an iterative process, it's something where critical thinking is used and where tough questions need to be asked and answered.


* The **goal** stage is extremely critical as a product leader. It is so easy to get lost in the amazing goals you can define for and with your team. However, all you need is one — one goal that will be your team’s north star.


* As we see more and more digital platforms and companies grow, the number of players in each is growing as well. Most people are using these platforms for good. However, there are also people who are trying to use these platforms for bad.

## Uniqueness in Your Idea: Building a Better Mousetrap
This article focused on the pros and cons of coming up with a creative idea. It's not enough to come up with a good idea, the real challenge is to get people to adopt a new idea rather than holding on to older ones. Human nature is to not like change, new ideas that can cause change are often rejected out of fear of something new. The article continued to use the idea of a mousetrap and how it's designed is hundreds of years old and out of the many ideas people have come up with to improve the design only maybe about twenty of them have been used. Below are some key concepts I've taken away from this resource.

* Often times we think that creating a new idea is to lead others to celebrate your accomplishments but often times than not people react in a negative way such as beat down your idea or worse ignore it altogether.


* Creative ideas, by their very nature invite **judgment**. People need to know if the value promised by the new idea is worth abandoning the old.


* It’s not enough for people to learn how to be more creative; they also need to be **persistent** through the **rejection** they might face.

## 15 Questions to Help Define Your Target Audience
This article focused on how to go about conducting a target market analysis to determine your ideal customer. Creating a target market profile is often the most overlooked and challenging aspect of online marketing. This is important to do though, without it you will most likely get a low response rate and you will waste a ton of money. The article then goes into fifteen questions you should ask yourself when trying to determine your target market profile. The questions range from where they live, how much money they make, how they communicate, and much more. Answering these questions will help determine your ideal customer for your product or business.

* Creating a target market profile is often the most overlooked and challenging aspect of online marketing. Without creating a target market profile you will likely get a low response rate and will waste a ton of money.


* One of the major questions you should ask yourself when trying to determine your target market profile is what your target demographic is. A demographic can be anything such as age group, gender, and marital status.


* Another major question you should ask yourself when trying to determine your target market profile is, can your service or product help them with these challenges? The answer should be yes or you need to reconsider your target audience.

* The most important question you should ask yourself when trying to determine your target market profile is, what are their biggest objections to using your service or product? Without answering this question, you will never get the conversions for your business that you want and expect.

## Market Segmentation and Your Users
This article focuses on understanding your users, developing a market segmentation plan, positioning your product, and creating a value proposition. Some market segmented practices this article covered were behavioral, psychographic, demographic, geographic, occasional, and cultural. Each practice explained in detail what each of them meant and how they related to your users and how to position your product.

* **Marketing segmentation** is a **marketing strategy** that involves **dividing** a broad target market into **subsets** of consumers who have common needs, wants, demands, or characteristics.


* **Behavioural segmentation** is a great place to **start** when you think about segmenting your market.

## How to Conduct a Competitive Analysis for Your Online Business
This article focuses on the realization that more than likely you will have competition in your market space which is good since that is a strong proxy for consumer demand but it also means that you will need to conduct a competitive analysis to ensure a high likely hood of success. A competitive analysis helps to identify the main market players, determine what strategies they use to succeed, and identify resources your company could use to dominate the market. The nine steps to a competitive analysis are as follows, identify your competitors, perform a competitor SWOT analysis, examine your competitors’ websites and customer experiences, determine your competitors’ market positioning, look at your competitors’ pricing and current offers, learn about the technology your competitors are using, ensure you are being competitive with shipping, review social media feedback and performance, use tools and methods for staying aware of competitors.

* **Competition** is a strong proxy for **consumer demand**. And where there’s demand, there’s **potential** for **growth** and ongoing **profits**.


* A c**ompetitive analysis** helps to **identify** the main market players, determine what strategies they use to **succeed**, and identify resources your company could use to **dominate** the market. 


* When doing **competitor research** using **RBV**, your goal is to determine how each company uses its resources to **secure/improve** its **market position**. The **two types** of resources RBV analyzes are **tangible assets** and **intangible assets**.

## Why Wireframing is Important
This article focuses on the importance of wireframes when creating a site. The article then continues on with reinforcing the importance of wireframes and why they are needed which are, wireframes display site architecture visually, wireframes allow for clarification of website features, wireframes push usability to the forefront, wireframes address scalability and ease-of-update, wireframes help make the design process iterative, wireframes save time on the entire project, and experience shows it works. After reviewing these points I understood the importance of wireframes when creating a site. This will be a helpful resource when planning out my wireframes this week.

![example wireframe](https://www.orbitmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wireframe-1.png)

* **Wireframes** are **simple** black and white **layouts** that outline the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas, and navigation for your website. They are devoid of color, font choices, logos, or any real design elements that take away from purely **focusing** on a site’s **structure**.


* Seeing the features **without** any **creative influence** allows a client to **focus** on other equally important aspects of the project and clarifies any **expectations** about how **features** will be **executed**. This will also save time later on in the project.


* Creating **wireframes** pushes **usability** to the forefront in **showcasing** page **layouts** at their core. It forces everyone to look objectively at a website’s ease of use, conversion paths, naming of links, navigation placement, and feature placement. **Wireframes** can **point** out **flaws** in site **architecture** or how a specific feature may work. Finding these issues early on is always better. 

* **Websites** need to remain **effective** through multiple business changes over the course of at least **two years**, which is the **average lifespan** of a **website**. The site needs to be scalable, flexible, and easy to update – without impacting the overall design. 

* **Skipping wireframes** delays this feedback and **increases the costs** of making changes because full design mock-ups must be reworked, not just simplified wireframes.

## Things to Avoid When Wireframing
This article focuses on the importance of wireframes when creating a site, what to avoid, and the benefits of creating wireframes. Starting off, the article goes into detail about what the purpose of a wireframe is, which is the skeleton of the page, usually drawn with basic shapes and lines with limited colors and styling. The article then went on to discuss what to avoid when wireframing such as having too much detail, including too much, in the beginning, may add confusion. Lastly, the article went into the different benefits of wireframing such as wireframes give the developer a clear picture of the elements that they will need to code. How should the layout adjusted for smaller-sized devices? What is the hierarchy of the content? How does the navigation respond to smaller screens? Looking over this research will help ensure that I don't fall into any pitfalls when creating my wireframes this week.

![low fidelity wireframe example](https://www.seguetech.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/images/blog-graphic-wireframe2.png)

* A **wireframe** is the **skeleton** of the page, usually **drawn** with **basic shapes** and lines with **limited colors** and styling. The point is to **focus** on figuring out **layout** and **content placement **and solving navigation and functionality problems in a format that is easy to adjust. 


* Something to **avoid** when wireframing is **having too much detail**. Including too much detail, in the beginning, may add confusion.


* **Wireframes** give the developer a **clear picture of the elements** that they will need to code. How should the layout adjusted for smaller-sized devices? What is the hierarchy of the content? How does the navigation respond to smaller screens?

## Wire Framing Steps
This article focuses on six different steps involved when making a wireframe. The article starts off by giving an introduction to wireframing such as, what is a wireframe, wireframe examples, things to consider before you start wireframing, and even some of the best tools to use for wireframing. Next, the article dives into the main focus of the article which is the six steps to make a wireframe, such as doing research, preparing your research for reference, making sure you have your user flow mapped out, drafting, adding detail, and testing into the mix, and turning your wireframes into prototypes. Lastly, the article gives some tips on how to make your wireframes good such as maintaining clarity, gaining user confidence, and simplicity is key. Although I have a decent understanding of wireframes, I believe this six-step process will be helpful when creating my wireframes this week.

* Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the **first two steps**; namely **understanding who your audience is** by way of user research, detailing requirements, **creating user personas** and defining use cases, and complementing this with a **further competitor and industry research**.

* **Good information** architecture will **ensure** that your **users are self-sufficient**, have **lower** levels of user **frustration**, and therefore **lower** drop-off or drop-out **rates**.

* Once you’ve **documented** and acted upon the **feedback** from your **first prototype**, you can start **developing** your **high-fidelity prototypes**.

* Your wireframe **needs to answer** the questions of **what that site page is**, what the user can do there, and if it **satisfies their needs**.

* **Ease of navigation** through your site and **clear calls-to-action** increase user **confidence** in your brand. If your site page is **unpredictable** or has buttons or boxes in **unexpected** places **user confidence diminishes**.

* Your **wireframe** should be a **visual guide** to the framework of your site and how it will be **navigated**. Attractiveness at this stage is **not** a consideration.

## Style Tiles
This article focuses on what a style tile is, why it is needed, and how it is used. The article started off by explaining what a style tile is which was defined as a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors, and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web. Next, the article went into more detail about when to use style tiles. The article stated that style tiles are for when a mood board is too vague and a comp is too literal. Lastly, the article went into a four-step process on how to use style tiles. The four steps were listening by having a design kick-off meeting and asking questions, interpreting by breaking down client feedback, defining a visual language from aggregated adjectives and beginning to match them up with styles, and lastly iterating.
 

* **Style Tiles** are a **design deliverable** consisting of fonts, colors, and interface elements that **communicate** the essence of a **visual brand** for the web.


* Style tiles are for when a **mood board is too vague** and a **comp is too literal**. 


* Your **clients** hold an **invaluable amount of information**, all you need to do is **listen**.

* Interpret how the **adjectives and themes** you discovered translate into **design principles** such as **balance and emphasis**. 

* Making changes in style out of the context of layout **takes less time** and allows you to **work faster**. Presenting multiple tiles gives you information to work with that can influence the evolution of a tile.

## Brand Fonts
This article focuses on understanding a brand's personality and how to find fonts that fit a budget, the user personality, and project requirements. The start of the article explains one part of the process which is picking the perfect fonts for your brand, which was explained as the perfect brand fonts should be unique and memorable, be legible, work on every platform, and communicate your brand personality. The article then went on to go more into detail about understanding the personality traits of each font category. Below is an image of the font personalities mentioned in the article. The article concluded by saying that much like any other brand design challenge, picking brand colors is all about finding fonts that match your brand personality.

![Font Personalities diagram](https://venngage-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/04/font-categories-personalities.png)

* The perfect **brand fonts** should be **unique and memorable**, be legible, work on every platform, and communicate your **brand personality**.


* Every **brand identity** needs a **well-defined brand personality**. A clear brand personality will be what your **customers relate with**, connect to, and remember you for. This can play a role in **increasing** your **brand awareness**.  


* **Font categories** are **classifications** that help designers choose, pair, and identify fonts.

* Before you get serious about picking your brand fonts, think about how you’re going to source your fonts. Some **font libraries** offer **free**, **open-source** fonts, including Google Fonts, Font Squirrel, and Font Library. 

* Some other font libraries offer **paid font licenses**, including Adobe Fonts, Linotype, Fonts.com. These libraries can give you access to **many more options**, but they can get **expensive**.

## Color Theory, Practice, and Inspiration
This article focuses on showing the importance of choosing the right colors. It provides the psychology of each color, tools for finding colors, and how to apply colors using inspiring color palettes. The article starts off by explaining the importance of color by stating that color is a key component of your business’s branding and also helps communicate important messaging to users as they interact with your site. An interesting tip the article gave was that a major goal of branding is to be easily recognizable, and color plays a huge role in that. The article then began diving into color theory and stated that color theory is a set of guidelines that artists and designers use to confer different ideas and feelings to audiences. Below are some key highlights from the article that I found interesting and helpful.

* **Color** is a **key component** of your business’s **branding**, and also helps communicate **important messaging** to users as they interact with your site.


* A **major goal** of branding is to be **easily recognizable**, and **color** plays a huge role in that.


* When **choosing colors** it is **important** to think about your **target audience**. For example, if you are targeting a younger audience then a visually interesting web color palette that is bright and playful will help them stay engaged. 

* When deciding on a website's **color scheme**, it's important to be **mindful** of **color psychology** and the effect color can have on the **emotions** of your site visitors. 

* Some website **color scheme generators** that are **free** and **easy to use** are Paletton, Coolors, and Canva’s color wheel.

## Types of Textures
This article focuses on seven tips for using background textures in web design. The article starts off by going through each tip starting with simple backgrounds, the article stated that simple background textures tend to have small or tight repeating patterns and can be almost any color. The idea is that these background textures aren’t a focal point; they serve to help bring attention to the rest of the design. On the opposite side of that point, the next tip was about big and bold background textures but the article stated that it can be a bit tricky using this type of background texture. This background texture can work for designs where the foreground is more text- or user interface element-heavy, and there aren’t other competing images to deal with. The article also talked more about color variations and the benefits that they can help create depth and visual interest. The article concluded that the trick to using textures is that they have to be subtle and actually fall into the background so that foreground elements are easy to read and understand.

* **Simple** background textures tend to have **small** or tight **repeating patterns** and can be almost any color. The idea is that these background textures **aren’t a focal point**; they serve to help **bring attention** to the rest of the **design**.


* **Color variations**, even those in the same family, can **create depth and visual interest**.


* **Gradients** are **trendy and visually engaging**. When it comes to using a gradient as a background texture, you can use it alone or layer it with a photo.

## What’s the Difference Between a Wireframe, a Prototype, and a Mockup?
This article is focused on why wireframes, prototypes, and mockups are so important. The article then starts going into detail about each topic such as what is a wireframe, what is a prototype, and what is a mockup. Afterward, the article gave out some information and resources of great tools that can be used to create the topics above. Below are some key concepts and some information I found interesting. This will be helpful as I continue with the design and planning stages of the final project this week and next.

* Wireframes, prototypes, and mockups **form three** of the **earlier steps** of a **product development** sequence. They offer UX (and UI) designers the opportunity to **conduct rounds** of **user testing** at each stage of their design process.


* Wireframes provide a **clear outline** of the **page structure**, layout, information architecture, and **overall direction**. A **wireframe traditionally** only uses **black**, **white**, and **grey**, and can either be drawn by hand or created digitally.


* **Low-fidelity prototypes** are vital for **generating user feedback**, as they allow the user to test the interaction flow without a vast expenditure of time or resources. **High-fidelity prototypes**, on the other hand, will **include color**, **text**, and **other content**, and often take the form of a fully functioning and coded website or app.

* A **mockup** is a static, high-fidelity **simulation** of the **finished product** that delivers the visual look of the product design—including typography, iconography, color, and overall style.

## How To Make Wireframes For Mobile Apps And Websites — And What’s The Difference?
This article focuses on what wireframing is, general best practices when wireframing, how to wireframe for mobile, how to wireframe for desktop, and what the difference between them is. Starting off, the article goes into detail about what wireframing is, based on this article a wireframe is a static low-to-mid fidelity simulation of the product concept, depicting the skeletal framework of a webpage or app. The article then moves on to talk about general wireframing best practices such as doing research, mapping out a user flow, choosing the right tools, and having function over form. The article continued into things to keep in mind when creating wireframes for mobile which include having finger-friendly designs, screen size limitations, mobile interaction conventions, and testing. When going into detail on how to best design wireframes for desktops these are some things to keep in mind which are nailing your message, dazzling with detail, and multimodality. The article then concluded with talking on how designing wireframes for desktop and mobile can be different and listed some of the ways such as size, behavior, and interaction. Keeping these concepts in mind as I work on my wireframes this week will be helpful in spotting some key things to keep in mind.
