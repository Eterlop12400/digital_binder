# Digital Binder

## Application Definition Statement

This proposal is for a website where users can collect, organize, and see their collection and/or deck stats at a glance. Digital Binder focuses on ease of use and more on the collection and value aspect. Users can make multiple decks and collections. Focusing on easy-to-use interfaces and more of a collection aspect will increase ease of access to users and will fill a much-needed hole missing in the market for a website like this for trading card game enthusiasts and collectors alike.

## Target Market

20 - 30-year-old male with a high school level education with a small amount of disposable income. Some hobbies include collecting, trading cards, playing card games, and enjoy going to local card shops.


## User Profile

A 20-year-old male who is single and enjoys collecting and playing trading card games who occasionally visits local card shops on the weekend with friends. 

## Use Cases

The use for this application would be looking at your dashboard to see your information on your collection or deck at a glance. The user can click and view their different collections or decks with a few easy clicks. A user can also explore more cards to view for informational purposes or can add them to a collection or deck.

## Problem Statement

The problem is that the few applications/sites that are out there try to do a bunch of things but fall short in areas that may include but are not limited to great UI/UX. They can feel clunky, slow, and even too spread out with features that make them a jack of all trades but a master of none. They also can show you a single card value but many of them don’t have a whole collection or deck stat feature. There aren’t many digital card collection apps for trading card games like Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, etc.

## Pain Points

The main pain point is a lack of choice in the market space for a digital collection, TCGplayer is the most used application in the market for a digital collection. They do many things well but they are more of a buy/sell application, they offer some organizational features but not as in-depth as Digital Binder will have. Another pain point includes many applications not being very easy to use or navigate or even creating multiple collections or decks. 

## Solution Statement

The solution is a simple one, Digital Binder will focus on the user and their collection. Digital Binder will focus on better organization of collections and decks, make a clean and easy-to-use layout for users, and allow users to create and use multiple collections and decks. Digital Binder will be focusing on a single aspect that has been lacking in the market which is strictly the collection side of things and the user experience.



## Competition

Some competing products that exist that are similar to Digital Binder are TCGplayer, Pokemon TCG Card Dex, Delver Lens, and BigAR's TCG Card Scanners. TCGplayer does a great job of adding a card to a collection but the application is mainly focused on the buying and selling aspect of trading cards. Pokemon TCG Card Dex is a great application for viewing Pokemon cards but doesn't have much variety. Each one of these applications focuses on either single cards, specifically on a single card game, or they are more of an e-commerce application. Many, if not all of them don't focus on the actual collection side of a TCG.
