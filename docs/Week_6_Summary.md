This week for my progress check, I wanted to report what I accomplished, what challenges I faced, what steps I have taken to get over those challenges, and lastly, my next steps leading into the following week. To start things off, some accomplishments I achieved this week are researching many different topics relating to Sequelize Seeding, Middleware, Routes/Controllers, and more. I dove into working on my backend after completing my research. Some challenges that I faced this week were setting up my routes and adding validation where needed. I overcame this challenge by doing some independent research and taking things one step at a time. Lastly, I wanted to talk about what I plan to do next. Next week I plan to focus more on the backend with sign in and sign up routes and starting to connect my pages to my API. That concludes my stand-up this week.
