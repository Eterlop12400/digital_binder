This week for my progress check, I wanted to report what I accomplished, what challenges I faced, what steps I have taken to get over those challenges, and lastly, my next steps leading into the future. To start things off, some accomplishments I achieved this week are researching many different topics relating to Heroku, clean code, refactoring, and more. I dove into working on my frontend after completing my research. Some challenges that I faced this week were getting my project production ready. I overcame this challenge by doing some independent research and taking things one step at a time, Heroku has a lot to offer but I will need to conduct more research in the future. Lastly, I wanted to talk about what I plan to do next. For the future I plan to focus on more on getting my project production ready on Heroku and I plan to add more features such as letting a user add their own cards and games. That concludes my stand-up this week.
