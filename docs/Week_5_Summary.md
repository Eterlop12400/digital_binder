This week for my progress check, I wanted to report what I accomplished, what challenges I faced, what steps I have taken to get over those challenges, and lastly, my next steps leading into the following week. To start things off, some of the accomplishments I achieved this week are researching many different topics relating to Sequelize Seeding, many-to-many relationships in sequelize, Routes/Controllers, and some independent investigation into the other connections in sequelize. I dove into working on my backend and database from completing my research. Some challenges that I faced this week were getting my project up and running on Heroku and started setting up my backend. I overcame this challenge by doing some independent research and taking one step at a time, a house can't be built by throwing every brick down all at once, so I did things step by step and accomplished my goals. Lastly, I wanted to talk about what I plan to do next. Next week I plan to focus more on the backend, create seeders for my database, and start working on routes/controllers. That concludes my stand-up this week.
