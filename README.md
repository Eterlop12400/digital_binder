## The Repository
This repository is where I develop the Digital Binder website. Not only do I work on code and issues here, but I also publish different documentations that are related to the project which can be found [here](https://github.com/ePortfolios/WDD4416-2201-TerlopEric/tree/main/docs).

## Digital Binder

Digital Binder is a website where users can collect, organize, and see their collection and/or deck stats at a glance. Digital Binder focuses on ease of use and more on the collection and value aspect. Users can make multiple decks and collections. Focusing on easy-to-use interfaces and more of a collection aspect will increase ease of access to users and will fill a much-needed hole missing in the market for a website like this for trading card game enthusiasts and collectors alike.
